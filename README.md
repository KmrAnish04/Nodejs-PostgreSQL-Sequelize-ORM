## Introduction

This project serves as a boilerplate for building Node.js applications with PostgreSQL and Sequelize. It includes essential configurations and examples to help you get started quickly.

## Features

- Sequelize ORM integration
- PostgreSQL database connection
- Model definitions and migrations
- Basic CRUD operations
- Environment-based configuration

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KmrAnish04/Nodejs-PostgreSQL-Sequelize-ORM.git
   cd Nodejs-PostgreSQL-Sequelize-ORM
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

### Database Setup:

- Create a PostgreSQL database for the project.

### Environment Variables:

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and other configuration settings.

   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASS=your_database_password
   ```

## Database Migration

Before running the application, ensure the database is up-to-date with the latest schema:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

This command will execute pending migrations and set up the database schema.

## Running the Application

To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The server will start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
